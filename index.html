  <a> Hi Circl team! I have manually coded this webpage from scratch to tell you all about why I would be a great fit for the Programme Officer Role. If you are not familiar with html but are curious about the amount of coding that goes into creating a even simple page like this, follow these steps to view the code:<br><br>
    PC:  <br><br>

    Firefox – CTRL + U (Meaning press the CTRL key on your keyboard and hold it down. While holding down the CTRL key, press the "u" key.) Alternatively, you can go to the "Firefox" menu and then click on "Web Developer," and then "Page Source."<br><br>
    Internet Explorer – CTRL + U. Or right click and select "View Source."<br><br>
    Chrome – CTRL + U. Or you can click on the weird-looking key with three horizontal lines in the upper right hand corner. Then click on "Tools" and select "View Source."
    Opera – CTRL + U. You also can right click on the webpage and select "View Page Source."<br><br>
      
    Mac:<br><br>

    Safari – The keyboard shortcut is Option+Command+U. You also can right click on the webpage and select "Show Page Source."<br><br>
    Firefox – You can right click and select "Page Source" or you can navigate to your "Tools" menu, select "Web Developer," and click on "Page Source." The keyboard shortcut is Command + U.<br><br>
    Chrome – Navigate to "View" and then click on "Developer" and then "View Source." You also can right click and select "View Page Source." The keyboard shortcut is Option+Command+U.<br><br>

        <h4 id="experience_text"> With 5 years of experience volunteering for charities and working in the hospitality industry, I would definitely call myself a people person. 
            In order to manage relationships with business professionals and future leaders, communication skills are important, and over the years I've not only practiced these but learnt valuable lessons such as how you say something is often as important as what you say. 
            <br> As for my administration skills, this webpage should give you an idea of the extent to which I am good with computers, but I also have developed plenty of organisational administration skills throughout my time at university and particularly through volunteering at Care4Calais. <br>
            My main volunteering role has been working as a Kurdish translator but I often manage databases containing sensitive information about refugees and asylum seekers, as well as creating and editing excel spreadsheets for goods distribution events. <br> 
            I have also had administration experience at my internship at Halpern PR, where my role included communicating with brands and representatives of public figures and updating brand social media pages.

              <h2 id="why_circl_heading"> Why Circl? </h2>  
    <h4 id="why_circl_text"> Since completing the Circl Leadership Programme I've become more aware of how important opportunities like these are to aid the social mobility of disadvantaged young people. While searching for career opportunities, I have seen first-hand how difficult it can be to break into corporate industries without the networking and training experiences that such organisations like Circl offer.
    <br> Given that Circl aims to both expand the networks of such young people as well as empower them, an internship at Circl would be incredibly fulfilling, something that I know is rare to find in any job. I am open to having my workplace skills challenged to allow myself to grow and as well as helping Circl to reach new heights. 
    <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>  Thank you for taking a look at my application page. <br> <br> This is my second time applying for this role so I would be really grateful to get the opportunity to interview with you this time round! </h4>
