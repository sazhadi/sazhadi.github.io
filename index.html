        <h2> A bit about me </h2>
        <p> I've just finished my BA French and Philosophy Degree at UCL and I am currently working towards becoming a software engineer by taking part in courses online. Coding is my main hobby at the moment and I would love to eventually use these skills for Circl if I get the job!</p>
