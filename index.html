  <a> Hi Circl team! I have manually coded this webpage from scratch to tell you all about why I would be a great fit for the Programme Officer Role. If you are not familiar with coding but are curious about the amount of coding that goes into creating a even simple page like this, follow these steps to view the code:<br><br>
   <b> PC: </b> <br><br>

Firefox – CTRL + U (Meaning press the CTRL key on your keyboard and hold it down. While holding down the CTRL key, press the "u" key.) Alternatively, you can go to the "Firefox" menu and then click on "Web Developer," and then "Page Source."<br><br>
Internet Explorer – CTRL + U. Or right click and select "View Source."<br><br>
Chrome – CTRL + U. Or you can click on the weird-looking key with three horizontal lines in the upper right hand corner. Then click on "Tools" and select "View Source."
Opera – CTRL + U. You also can right click on the webpage and select "View Page Source."<br><br>
<b>Mac:</b><br><br>

Safari – The keyboard shortcut is Option+Command+U. You also can right click on the webpage and select "Show Page Source."<br><br>
Firefox – You can right click and select "Page Source" or you can navigate to your "Tools" menu, select "Web Developer," and click on "Page Source." The keyboard shortcut is Command + U.<br><br>
Chrome – Navigate to "View" and then click on "Developer" and then "View Source." You also can right click and select "View Page Source." The keyboard shortcut is Option+Command+U.<br><br>

  document.getElementById("mySidebar").style.width = "250px";

        <h4 id="about_text"> Last month, I completed my BA French and Philosophy degree at UCL and I am currently working towards becoming a software engineer through online courses. <br> Coding is my main hobby at the moment but I also like to spend my time upcycling clothes or spending a weekend in Latvia. </h4>

        <h4 id="experience_text"> Having had 5 years of experience volunteering for charities and working in the hospitality industry, it is safe to say that I am a 'people person'. To manage relationships with business professionals and future leaders, communication skills are important, and over the years I've not only practiced these but learnt valuable lessons such as how you say something is often as important as what you say. 
              <br> As for my administration skills, this webpage should give you an idea of the extent to which I am good with computers, but I also have developed plenty of organisational administration skills throughout my time at university and particularly through volunteering at Care4Calais. <b>
            My main volunteer role has been working as a translator but I have also had to manage databases containing sensitive information about refugees and asylum seekers, and also create and edit excel spreadsheets for goods distribution events. <br>
